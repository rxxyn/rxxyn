## Hello!!! I am rxxyn.

#### I am a YouTuber, programmer, and game developer.
#### I am currently working on a VR horror game named "MENTAL". 
#### I have most experience in Photon PUN and Unity.

## My Platforms
#### [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCInUBnHvFN7QkND56CZk8vw)
#### [My Game Studio](https://newleafstudios.org)


## My Projects 
- [Mirror VR](https://github.com/rxxyn/MirrorVR) is a Unity plugin that uses the Epic Online Services transport with Mirror to create a easy, free, and beginner-friendly experience for multiplayer VR games.
- [Easy Editor Defines](https://github.com/rxxyn/EasyEditorDefines) is a Unity plugin that replaces Unity editor defines with normal bools so it doesn't make your code messy and makes it look better!
